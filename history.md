# History and Reflection

December 13th : Creating story on google docs. Almost done chapter two. This'll lead into the final chapters.
December 19th: Finished basic story and the extra endings.(milestone 1) Coding time!
december 20th: Created a project folder as well as seperate files for each section in the story
January 7th: Folder bug fixes and a start on user input.
January 8th: Created images for choice buttons. Attempting to make the buttons and user input..., Begin plans of an array to hold the endings in.
January 9th: I found p5.js/dom this will help me with user input and displaying the story. I also created my canvas and images. So that's nice. 
January 10th: I have given up on the p5.js/dom and I'm gonna use just the basic javascript. It's okay though because I can still get user input. Yay
January 11th: I got user input to finally work. But displaying text is actual hell. (milestone 2)
January 14th: Text has been displayed. Next stop,,,,,,, choices!!! We got this boys.
jan 15th: I have text in my code. Finished putting in true ending. now i gotta program it lol. Arrays. (milstone 2.5)
January 16th: Turns out I will need state variables. My goal is to do this afterschool and in my spares tomorrow before my presentation.


January 21st: The project is due today. In hindsight, the issues I was given revolved around attempting to use a library that I wasn't present for in class. The second I stopped using the library, I started making big strides. I feel as though that if I had used a simpler method earlier, I would have my whole need to have list completed. Another issue I had was using atom at home. Even after I downloaded all the packages and made chrome my default browser, I still couldn't run any of my projects. It was very difficult to get work done at home because of this. I think I did all that I could and I did work hard at this. Overall, I'm proud that I had completed the majority of the need to have list. In the future, I think using maps would have been quite helpful for me.
