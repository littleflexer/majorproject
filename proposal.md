# My proposal

Oh boy end of semester one! I want to build an epic choose your own adventure.

## Need to have list
- Storyline/Characters (embedded text if the Nice to Have videos don't work)
    - find a way to show the various 'chapters' of the story
- User input (movie review code)
    - Hold answer in strings 
        -Have answers appear in the story (ie " Hi my name is [user input]. I like the color [user input 2].)
- Choices (ie pressing buttons for different answers)
    - array to hold choices
        -Ability to pull specific choices and recall them (I could just write that into the story though...)

## Nice to have list
- Sound effects
- Simon says mini game (win = safer choice)
- unique font to display text
- The scenes be videos embedded into the code. (links to a youtube page possibily)
