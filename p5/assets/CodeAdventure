You decide to just walk home instead. You pass the climbing tree, the rusty bench, and all the usual sites. You get down to your street and enter the pink house in the corner. You go inside, she made you dinner. It’s spaghetti. You gladly eat the spaghetti and head to bed.
   				Your story ends with you being a normal kid with a boring and normal life. But you got spaghetti. You love spaghetti.

You yell, “Look out!” Before making a dash into the forest. You increase your speed as you duck under branches and leap over stones. Just then you hear a voice yell, “Stupify!” You are unconscious.

You wake up in a dungeon on an old cot. You should have heard the man out. But it’s to late.
“Dinner!”
What was that?
“DINNER!”

You creep to the door and you open it up. Oh yeah! You styled your room like a medieval dungeon last year. You probably just dreamed all that, who knows though.

You mind your own business and you head back to the common room. The rest of the year goes on to be pretty normal, if you ignore that Dumbledore, Cedric, Lavender, and Pansy were brutally murdered by some guy named Voldemort.

The year comes to an end and dad picks you up from the train station. He brings you home to your mother. He brought you a grilled cheese sandwich.

	You step out of the way and Snape rushes past you and towards the bridge. The centaur speaks in a wise tone, “Are you kids okay?” None of you respond.

	“Let me guide you to Dumbledore. I’ll explain everything” He says. The centaur proceeds to explain that unicorn blood has the ability to help you live forever, as evil as it may be, the hooded figure was taking advantage of that.

	You, your friends, and the centaur find Dumbledore waiting just inside the castle. “I have come to understand that you have seen somethings tonight that no children should ever see. I deeply apologize and actions will take place in order to bring justice. 10 points will be awarded to each of you for curiosity. Now off to bed,” He says in a soothing tone before vanishing deeper into the castle.

True Ending
	The next night, you sit at the tables in the great hall. Dumbledore announces to the school that Gilderoy Lockhart (Dad) will be the new potions master and Remus Lupin will be the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher.  Peace is temporarily restored in hogwarts and you are deemed a hero.
